This file is intended to be used as a bulletin board whereby the Atlas
Annotation Workbench developers exchange ideas, notes, task and any
other comments that would be useful.

##  Coding Pointers   ##
########################

To initialize a file for annotation:
1. Retrieve the implementation to be used for the corpus if we don't
already have it
	 implementation = ATLASImplementationManager.getDefaultImplementation();
	 implementation = corpus.getAtlasImplementation(); // if existing corpus
2. retrieve the AtlasElementFactory for the chosen implementation if we
don't already have it:
	 factory = ATLASElementFactory.getFactoryFor(implementation);
3. Create a corpus for the file (or figure out which one you're adding
it to) - type "simple"?? (type must be defined in MAIA file)
	 corpus = factory.createCorpus(type)
4. Create a simpleSignal for the file and add it to the corpus
	 Signal signal = factory.createSimpleSignal("text", corpus, 
		MIMEClass.TEXT, mimetype, encoding, null, "file://somefile.txt");
5. Create analyses or annotationSets (??) appropriate to the task type??????
6. Create LinkedListATLASElementSet for anchors and regions, so we can 
iterate over them later
7. Create hash tables to index elements as needed (needs to be determined as 
we progress...)

##  GUI Ideas  ##
#################

Main Widget
  - title bar
  - Incorporates menus across the top
  - Identifies current source file/corpus being annotated
  - Contains Text Widget
  - Tear-off-capable Text-Selection-Prefs menu
  - "mouse line" text bar (at top or bottom of text pane) in which
    advice to user of various kinds can be displayed.
  - Includes info indicating current pre-defined annotation task
    preferences (combination of TAG-preferences and TASK preferences
    in Alembic Workbench): NE, EDT, RDC.


Text-Widget-Behavior-Prefs menu:
  - Select text for EDT mention
  - Select mentions for EDT


Text Widget:
  - Displays multi-lingual UTF-8 text
  - Handles bi-directionality of texts
  - Renders arabic properly (ligatures, etc.)
  - Scrolling text
  - Swipe: select text
  - All text that is part of a mention of an entity is colored
    according to the user's preferences for entities/mentions
    of that type.
  - As mouse moves over text, any text that is part of a mention
    of an entity is further highlighted and the mouse icon changes
    to indicate that this mention is selectable.
  - Right-button over text that is ALREADY part of a mention:
      Bring up Manipulate-MENTION-Selection menu.
  - Left-button over text that is ALREADY part of a mention:
      Bring the entity and this mention into "focus"
        - in the Mentions-List widget
        - in the Entity-List widget
        - in the Entity-Relations widget
      (If this is a Timex2 mention, then it only becomes the
       focus of the Mentions-List widget.)
  - Left-button over text that is *not* already part of a mention:
      - If no current text selection, then select "word" under
        mouse as current text selection (as appropriate for language)
      - If there already is a "current text selection," then extend
        it left one more "word"
  - Right-button over text that is *not* already part of a mention
      - If no current text selection, then select "word"
      - If there already is a "current text selection," then extend
        it right one more "word"
  - Double-Right-Button (or, gulp, Ctrl-Right-Button?):
    - If current text selection is in progress, then bring up
      the Manipulate-TEXT-Selection menu pop-up (see below)
      [I know, this might be too-many clicks to get this basic
       menu to appear.  But the left/right button thing to
       select the contents of a mentions just seems so "right."]
  - Left-Arrow
      - If current text selection, extend left one more "word"
  - Right-Arrow
      - If current text selection, extend right one more "word"
  - Escape
      - Kill any "current context," especially those in which
        more user input is being waited for by the application


Manipulate-TEXT-Selection popup menu contents:
  - Add mention to existing entity --> (cascades to Select-Entity menu)
  - Create new entity with this mention --> (cascades to Create-Entity menu)
  - Create timex2 mention
  - Remove selection (don't want to tag this text after all)


Select-Entity popup menu:
  - Scrolling list of all entities (preferred names + unique IDs)
  - Cancel addition of mention to entity
    (selected mention text disappears)

  ==> After entity is selected, text in "mouse line" text bar appears
   requesting that HEAD of mention should be specified/selected. [This
   also has the effect of causing the text selection via the mouse to
   behave as if there were no mention underneath text being selected.]
   If head identical to extent, then user can hit <Return>.  Hitting
   ESC will cancel the mention creation altogether.]


Create-Entity popup menu:
  - Select Entity Type (listed right here in widget, no more cascading)
  - Cancel creation of entity
    (selected mention text disappears)

  ==> After entity is created, same HEAD prompting as above.


Manipulate-MENTION-Selection popup menu contents:

    Mention-Level Actions
  - Remove mention from this entity
  - Set as Preferred-Mention-Display (toggle on only)
  - Set Syntactic-Type --> (cascades to syntactic type list)
  - Set Metonymic-Level --> (cascades to metonymic level list)
  - Set Metonymic-Role (greyed out unless this is a GPE) -->
     (cascades to GPE metonymic role list)
  - Change extent of mention (causes mention to be in "select" mode
    so that it's left/right boundaries can be manipulated, using
    either left/right mouse buttons or arrow keys)
  - Change extent of mention head (same as above)

    Entity-Level Actions
  - Remove this entity (the one for which this is a mention)
  - Change Entity Type --> (cascades to entity type list)
  - Change Specific/Generic value (toggle)
  - Add Relation to Entity --> (cascades to specifying RDC type
      and thence to subtype lists)
    ==> Enter Relation-Definition-Mode.

Relation-Definition-Mode:
  After relation type/subtype is specified, this entity and new
  relation becomes "focus" in RDC widget, with the type/subtype values
  already set.  Default values are pre-set for Explicit/Implicit
  value.  In the absence of semantic constraints, the selected entity
  becomes the "Arg-1" for this relation.  At the same time, the user
  is "prompted" for Arg-2 and then Timex2 Mention, if any (with
  directions provided via "mouse line" text pane).  Arg-2 entity, the
  entity mention, and the Timex2 mention must all have been defined
  already (they can't be defined at this point).  If the user hits
  <Return> to either or both of the Arg-2 and Timex2 prompts, then
  these values are left empty (to be filled in through interactions
  with the RDC-Relations widget).


        
Mentions-List widget:
  [Display all the mentions for a particular entity in tabular form,
   one per line]


EDT-Entity-List widget:
  [Display all the entities in tabular form, one per line]


RDC-Entity-Relations-List widget:
  [Display all the relations for a particular EDT entity in tabular form.]
