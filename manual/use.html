          <h2>ACE Annotation Task Tutorial</h2>
          <p> The ACE annotation task is also known as the RDC
            annotation task.
          </p>
          <div class="subsection"><a name="Opening_files_for_annotation"></a>
            <h3>Opening files for annotation</h3>
            <p> There are three ways to begin annotating a file:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>File-&gt;New will create a new annotation file for a
                raw data file</li>
              <li>File-&gt;Open will open an AIF file previously created
                by Callisto.</li>
              <li>File-&gt;Import will use a Task specific mechanism to
                convert from some other data type to the task specified</li>
            </ol>
            <p> The RDC Task defines a single importer for the ACE Pilot
              Format (APF).
            </p>
            <p> All data annotated by this version of Callisto are saved
              in AIF format. Tasks may also define Exporters, which
              would convert to an external format of the Tasks choosing.
            </p>
            <p> Note that when loading an APF file, the "signal" file
              (or "source document") annotated by the APF stand off
              annotations will be a separate file. This source document
              file annotated by the APF is indicated within the APF
              itself and must (obviously) be present in order to perform
              annotation. The APF2AIF conversion process that happens
              automatically when loading an APF file is able to find the
              name of this source document file. Since the source
              document file is specified without any directory prefixes,
              it is assumed and required that the source document is
              located within the same directory as the APF file being
              opened. The APF2AIF conversion process then creates a raw
              text file (called ${source-document}.txt, where
              ${source-document} is the name of the source document
              annotated by the APF, *not* the APF file itself).
            </p>
            <p> In order to load annotations created by an earlier
              session with Callisto, one needs to load the AIF file
              associated with those earlier annotations. Thus, even if
              one specified a raw text file "foo.txt" as input to an
              earlier Callisto annotation session, all the annotations
              associated with that session will be saved in an AIF file
              (for example, "foo.txt.aif"). To see and update these
              earlier annotations one must open the AIF file
              ("foo.txt.aif"). Since AIF, like APF, is a stand off XML
              annotation format, there are mechanisms within the AIF
              file that refer to the original raw text file (referred to
              in the ATLAS annotation model as the "signal"), so
              Callisto will be able to retrieve this original text file
              in order to properly display it along with the annotations
              on that file. (See the bug/limitations notes below on
              moving or transporting AIF files.)
            </p>
            <p> To make it easy to revert to earlier versions of a set
              of annotations, Callisto generates backup copies of the
              annotations files that are saved separately from the
              primary named annotation file. The format of these backup
              files is *.aif.${integer}.xml, where ${integer} takes on
              ever increasing values as new versions are saved to disk.
              The user can select in the preferences window how many
              previous versions are to be maintained at any given time.
            </p>
            <p> Here are some examples of entering files into Callisto,
              using sample ACE (RDC) data found in the <code>${CALLISTO}/data/ACE/</code>
              directory. Entering (and saving) files involve the use of
              "File" drop-down menu, which is in the upper left-hand
              corner of the Callisto window (circled in dashed red in
              the image below):

          <div class="subsection"><a name="Saving_annotations"></a>
            <h3>Saving annotations</h3>
            <p> To save your annotation, you must choose a file name
              which will be recognized as AIF, having an extension as
              listed above (*.aif, *.aif.xml, *.aif.*.xml). Once saved,
              do not move the signal file. Callisto uses standoff
              annotation, and enforces a 'no change to the signal'
              policy that includes the signal's location. If the signal
              file is moved in any way, (even if the annotation file
              moves with it) you will no longer be able to reload the
              annotations (see Known Bugs and Limitations #1 below, for
              more information). This restriction can be surmounted by
              carefully editing the AIF file itself. If you need to do
              this, please contact MITRE.
            </p>
            <p> To save out the annotations (using the AIF format): </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Mouse on: "File" -&gt; "Save As"<br>
                <br>
                A pop-up window will appear.</li>
              <li>Browse to where you want the saved file to go</li>
              <li>Change the file name to save out to what you would
                like</li>
              <li>Press "Save"</li>
            </ol>
            <p></p>
          </div>
          <div class="subsection"><a
              name="The_Callisto_Interface_for_ACE"></a>
            <h3>The Callisto Interface for ACE</h3>
            <p> Upon opening a file for ACE annotation in Callisto, one
              is presented with a main text screen in which the raw text
              of the original file is displayed. At the bottom of the
              main window are a number of distinct "sheets" that can be
              displayed in the same space by selecting the appropriate
              "tab" indicating their contents: Mention, Entities,
              Relations. These tables are used to display the various
              kinds of ACE annotations. A useful layout is to "tear off"
              the Entity and Relations tables to enable them to be
              placed in a separate location on the user's desktop. This
              can be done by clicking on the icon (looks like two
              overlapping rectangles) immediately to the left of the tab
              labels. Another useful "default" layout selection is to
              select (check the box) of the "Text Palette" option
              underneath the "Edit" pull down menu.
            </p>
            <p> Text in the main text viewing window can be selected by
              swiping the mouse while depressing the left button. The
              default behavior is to have the tool itself automatically
              select words at what it deems are word boundaries. If this
              default behavior interferes with sub-word selections, the
              user can change this preference from the "Selection Mode"
              option underneath the "Edit" pull down menu (changing it
              to Character mode). Selecting text does not itself create
              a mention annotation. A mention annotation is created when
              text has been selected and then either (a) the right
              button is selected and an appropriate action is selected
              from the pop-up menu, (b) the desired action is selected
              directly from the "Text Palette" widget, or (c) the user
              presses the middle button, in which case the default
              action associated with the "Text Palette" widget
              (indicated by the black circle button in the right hand
              column) is taken. It will often be useful to have the
              default action be "New Mention", which will enable the
              annotator to only rarely be forced to use either the
              text-centered pop-up menu of actions or the text palette
              actions.
            </p>
            <p> Mention annotations can be selected by clicking on them
              (by default the most recently created mention is the
              current selection). When selected, a small line on top and
              below the annotated text appears to indicate that it is
              the selection mention. If a given bit of text has multiple
              mention annotations, the user can place the mouse directly
              over the multiply-annotated text and hit tab to "cycle"
              through the various co-extensive annotations.
            </p>
            <p> Creating a mention creates two phrases at once that are
              linked together: the "full" extent of the mention, and the
              "head" of the mention. A new entry in the Mentions table
              is created in which the various attributes of the mention
              are displayed explicitly. By default the head and full
              extent of a mention are co-extensive. To change the extent
              of either the head (the usual case when a modification is
              necessary) or the full extent, one swipes the desired text
              to create a new selection, then either (a) clicks the
              right button and selects the "Modify Head Extent" entry of
              the pop-up menu, (b) selects the same entry from the
              free-standing "Text Palette," or (c) clicks the middle
              button if it so happens that the user has selected "Modify
              Head Extent" as the default action in the Text Palette
              window (indicated by the black circle to its left).
              Attributes of mentions besides their textual extent can be
              modified directly from within the mentions table.
            </p>
            <p> To create an EDT entity, one selects a row in the
              mention table or selects a mention annotation from within
              the text window pane, and then clicks right to get the
              pop-up window. This will present "Add to Entity" and
              "Create new Entity" as two options. If one selects "Add to
              Entity", the tool expects the user to immediately follow
              that selection with a left mouse click on the row in the
              entity table that indicates the entity to which the
              mention should be attached. A similar action, but with a
              different action selected, allows one to add a selected
              mention to a relation (either as an Arg1 or Arg2 filler.
              The other attributes of entities and relations are set
              just as in the mentions table --- these values are all
              drop-menus that are set by clicking on the cell and
              selecting from the pop-up menu.

            <h3>Sample ACE data</h3>
            <p> Some sample ACE data is provided in the <code>${CALLISTO}/data/ACE/</code>
              directory. There are four types of files:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>*.sgm.tmx.rdc.apf.xml: An APF file. Can input into
                Callisto via "Import".</li>
              <li>*.sgm: An sgml file. In these samples, they are the
                "signal" files that the *.sgm.tmx.rdc.apf.xml files
                point to.</li>

                <br>
                Note: some versions of Callisto save out in a slightly
                different format. But these sample files are still
                readable by Callisto.</li>
              <li>*.sgm.tmx.rdc.apf.xml.txt: A plain text file. Can
                input into Callisto via "New".<br>
                <br>
                In these samples, they are also the "signal" files that
