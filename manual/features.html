          <h2>Features</h2>
          <p> Callisto provides a number of features which make it an
            easy tool to use for annotations tasks of all types. An
            important note is that this list is always growing as we
            address feedback provided. While effort is made to keep
            documentation up to date, please bear with our
            discrepancies. Please submit your own feeddback using our <a
              href="../contact.html">contacts</a> page. </p>
          <div class="subsection"><a name="Main_Window"></a>
            <h3>Main Window</h3>
            <p>Callisto's main window is broken into two parts, the
              'Main Text Pane' on top, and the 'Editor Pane' on bottom.
              The editor pane is generally customized for the annotation
              task at hand, while the main text pane is expected to
              remain fairly constant. The text in the main text pane
              cannot be edited, only annotated. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="subsection"><a name="Annotating_Text"></a>
            <h3>Annotating Text</h3>
            <p>To annotate text, swipe the text of interest, and click
              the desired 'New annotation' action from the context menu
              or by using the text palette/default action (See below).
              The new annotation will become the single selected
              annotation (see Selecting and De-selecting below). </p>
          </div>
          <div class="subsection"><a
              name="Selected_Swiped_Text_vs__Selected_Annotations"></a>
            <h3>Selected/Swiped Text vs. Selected Annotations</h3>
            <p>Callisto provides visual indicators of annotations on
              regions of text (by changing the associated background
              color). To create a new annotation on a given portion of
              text the user must "swipe" or "select" the desired region
              of text. This selection of text <em>also</em> provides a
              visual feedback to the user. Both of these kinds of visual
              feedback we refer to generally as "highlighting." The user
              of Callisto needs to understand the distinction between
              selected/swiped text and selected annotations. </p>
            <p>"Selected" annotations appear in the text with black
              highlights above and below. "Swiped" text is what most
              editors and browsers refer to as "selected" text, created
              by left-clicking (usually the left button) and dragging
              over some text to "highlight" it. "Highlight" is an
              ambiguous word in Callisto, and we try to use it within
              context. To 'de-swipe' text, click in an area of the text
              pane with no text, or press the escape key (while the main
              text pane is active). Different actions are available at
              different times depending on what annotations are
              selected, and whether or not text is swiped. This is
              reflected by changes in the context menus and Text Palette
              (see below). </p>
          </div>
          <div class="subsection"><a name="Selecting_and_Deselecting"></a>
            <h3>Selecting and Deselecting</h3>
            <p>More than one annotation can be selected at a time. An
              annotation automatically becomes the single selected
              annotation when it is first created from text. Select a
              different annotation by clicking the left mouse-button
              over it. Additional annotations can be selected by holding
              the SHIFT key down while clicking other text annotations
              with the left button. To de-select annotations press
              escape (you need to do this twice if text is also swiped)
              or select a different annotation. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="subsection"><a name="Changing_Tag_Extents"></a>
            <h3>Changing Tag Extents</h3>
            <p>When text annotations are created, all of its extents are
              set to the same values. As in the case with ACE EDT
              Mentions, some text annotations can have multiple extents.
              To change an extent of an annotation, simply select the
              annotation to change, swipe the region of text you wish
              the extent to be, and click the appropriate 'Modify'
              action in the text palette, or context menu (see below).
              If there is only one extent (as in RDC Timex) there will
              be only one Modifier option. For multiple extent tags
              (such as EDT Mentions) there will be one modifier for each
              extent. Note that there may be special handling operations
              associated with such actions. For example, for EDT
              Mentions changing the head extent will always be
              associated with a check that the new head extent is
              contained within the full extent, even if this requires
              changing the full extent at the same time. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="subsection"><a
              name="Overlapping_Tags_and_the_Inspection_Panel"></a>
            <h3>Overlapping Tags and the Inspection Panel</h3>
            <p>When annotations overlap, it can be very hard to tell
              what annotations exist on that part of the text. The
              annotations in the text panel can be inspected by moving
              the mouse cursor over an annotation. At the bottom of the
              main text a gray 'panel' will display a text
              representation of whatever annotations are under the
              mouse. When more than one annotation exists at a point,
              each will each appear on a separate line. To bring an
              annotation to the 'front', from behind, press the tab key,
              while the mouse is over the overlapping tags in question.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="subsection"><a name="Word_vs__Character_swiping"></a>
            <h3>Word vs. Character swiping</h3>
            <p>Different languages can have vastly different glyphs and
              concepts of tokenization. To accommodate, Callisto allows
              text to be swiped in units of characters or words. The
              word segmenter is a modified version of the standard Java
              WordBreakIterator which breaks hyphenated words into
              multiple tokens. Change the Swipe style (either Word or
              Character) from the Callisto MenuBar: <code>Edit-&gt;Swipe

                Text by Word</code> </p>
          </div>
          <div class="subsection"><a name="Context_Menus"></a>
            <h3>Context Menus</h3>
            <p>Right-click on items will often bring up a specialized
              pop-up menu of actions available for the item under the
              cursor. Swiped areas of text, selected annotations, and
              rows in tables, all have context menus. The main text
              pane's context menu duplicates the actions provided in the
              Text Palette (see below), providing a separate means of
              working, depending on the annotator's preferred style. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="subsection"><a
              name="Available_Actions_and_Default_Action"></a>
            <h3>Available Actions and Default Action</h3>
            <p>The 'Avalable Actions' tool is a floating window that
              shows the actions available to the main text pane, as
              buttons. The 'default action' is activated by clicking the
              middle mouse button in the main text pane. Buttons in the
              text palette duplicate the text pane's context pop-up menu
              (see above), with a small round toggle button next to
              each, indicating which is currently the default. Actions
              will become disabled depending on what the annotator is
              doing at any given time (see Selected vs. Swiped above),
              and if the default action becomes disabled, clicking the
              middle mouse button will have no effect. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="subsection"><a name="Tear_off_Tabs"></a>
            <h3>Tear off Tabs</h3>
            <p>Some annotation tasks use multiple tables in tear off
              tabs. These tabs can 'float' separate from the main
              window. To tear off a tab, click the 'floating window'
              icon in the tab you wish to tear off. Floating windows are
              automatically reattached by closing them. Floating windows
              remember their positions between annotation sessions. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="subsection"><a name="Font_Size"></a>
            <h3>Font Size</h3>
            <p>The user can quickly change the font size in the main
              text pane from the Callisto MenuBar <code>Format-&gt;Font
                Size-&gt;...</code> </p>
          </div>
          <div class="subsection"><a name="Unicode_Texts"></a>
            <h3>Unicode Texts</h3>
            <p>Java has the ability to display most languages of the
              world which have character sets in the Unicode standard.
              You must however have fonts installed on your computer to
              view these other texts (see the Install section above).
              Callisto takes advantage of this by choosing the most
              appropriate font for the text being annotated. Currently
              Callisto can only annotate files with UTF-8 or US-ASCII
              text (which is a proper subset of UTF-8), although we
              intend to handle conversions from other character sets in
              the future. If Callisto fails to recognize a font which
              should be rendered Right-to-Left, you can quickly change
              the orientation by selecting "Right-to-Left Orientation"
              in the Callisto "Format" MenuBar. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="subsection"><a name="User_Preferences"></a>
            <h3>User Preferences</h3>
            <p>The user can set various user preferences in the
              'Preferences Dialog' which appears by selecting <code>Edit-&gt;Preferences...</code>
              in the Callisto MenuBar. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="subsection"><a
              name="Annotation_Highlights_and_Task_Preferences"></a>
            <h3>Annotation Highlights and Task Preferences</h3>
            <p>Each task defines it's own preferences and annotation
              highlight colors. These can also be edited in the
              preferences dialog. In the lower portion of the preference
              tree you see an item for each task known to Callisto. Each
              task's editor panel includes a table to edit the highlight
              colors it knows of. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="subsection"><a name="Hiding_Tags"></a>
            <h3>Hiding Tags</h3>
            <p>Tags may be 'hidden' from view from a task's Preferences
              as well. This can make the tagging task much easier by
              clearing clutter in the text document. Each tag has a
              checkbox which will toggle the tags visibility in the text
              pane. Visibility is remembered between sessions. </p>
            <p>All tags are visible by default. </p>
